**Title:** I solved my waitlist problem with Next.js and Google Sheets - sharing the solution

**Post:**
Hey r/webdev!

After struggling to find a simple way to collect emails for my side project, I built a solution I thought might help others here too.

**The problem:**
I wanted to validate a new idea with a waitlist but found myself facing these challenges:
- Setting up a database just for collecting emails felt excessive
- Paid waitlist services were an unnecessary cost for an unproven concept
- Existing solutions required more setup than I wanted to deal with

**The solution I built:**
A waitlist signup page built with Next.js 15 that stores emails directly in Google Sheets - no database required.

**How it works:**
- Form submissions are handled by Next.js Server Actions
- Emails are sent securely to Google Sheets API (no exposed API keys)
- Simple validation ensures you only collect valid emails
- Dark/light theme and responsive design for good UX on any device

I've made it completely open-source in case anyone else finds themselves in the same situation.

**GitHub repo:** https://github.com/dambrubaba/google-sheet-waitlist
**Live demo:** [https://prompt-waitlist.vercel.app/]

It takes about 10 minutes to customize and deploy. I'd love to hear your thoughts or suggestions for improvement!

*Edit: For transparency, I'm the creator of this project. I built it for my own needs and decided to open-source it to help others.*

### r/nextjs

**Title:** Using Server Actions + Google Sheets API as a simple data store

**Post:**
Hey Next.js folks!

I recently needed a way to collect waitlist emails for a new project, and I thought I'd share how I solved it using Server Actions and Google Sheets.

**The challenge:**
I wanted something that:
- Didn't require a traditional database setup
- Had minimal ongoing costs
- Was simple to deploy and maintain

**My solution:**
I created a waitlist page that stores submissions directly in Google Sheets:
- Uses the App Router and Server Actions
- Keeps API credentials secure (server-side only)
- Has client and server validation
- Features a flip-card UI with dark/light theme

The most interesting part is how Server Actions simplify the backend - no need for API routes, and all sensitive operations happen server-side.

I've open-sourced the whole thing:
- GitHub: https://github.com/dambrubaba/google-sheet-waitlist
- Demo: [https://prompt-waitlist.vercel.app/]

Has anyone else found creative ways to use Server Actions? Would love to hear what you've built or any suggestions to improve this approach!

*Edit: I'm the creator of this project. Built it as a solution to my own problem and thought it might help others in the community.*

# Waitlist Boilerplate: A Next.js Waitlist Page with Google Sheets Integration

I'm excited to share a project I built to help developers quickly set up waitlist pages for their products: an open-source waitlist landing page that stores email submissions directly in Google Sheets.

## Why I built this

As an indie hacker, I often need to validate ideas quickly by setting up waitlist pages. I found myself repeating this process and facing the same challenges:

1. Setting up a database just to store emails seemed excessive
2. Paid waitlist services added unnecessary costs for MVPs
3. Existing solutions were often complex or outdated

So I created this waitlist boilerplate - a simple, elegant solution that uses Google Sheets as the database.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** with App Router and Server Actions
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui** for styling
- **Google Sheets API** for data storage
- **React Hook Form** + **Zod** for validation

## Key Features

- **Beautiful Flip-Card UI**: Animated card that flips to show product features
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between themes with a click
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Store emails directly in your sheet
- **Mobile Responsive**: Looks great on all devices
- **Email Validation**: Client and server-side validation
- **Detailed Documentation**: Step-by-step setup guide
- **One-Click Deployment**: Deploy to Vercel instantly

## Demo & Code

- **GitHub Repo**: [https://github.com/dambrubaba/google-sheet-waitlist](https://github.com/dambrubaba/google-sheet-waitlist)
- **Live Demo**: [https://prompt-waitlist.vercel.app/]

## How it Works

The application uses Next.js Server Actions to securely send email submissions to the Google Sheets API. This means:

1. No exposed API keys in the client
2. No need for a separate backend or database
3. Emails are stored directly in your own Google Sheet

## Getting Started

Setup takes less than 10 minutes:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a Google Cloud project and enable the Sheets API
3. Set up a service account and get credentials
4. Create a Google Sheet and share it with your service account
5. Add your credentials to environment variables
6. Deploy to Vercel (or your preferred hosting)

Detailed instructions are in the README.

## Why Google Sheets?

Using Google Sheets as a database offers several advantages:

- **Zero Config**: No database setup or maintenance
- **Familiar Interface**: Easy to view, sort, and filter submissions
- **Collaboration**: Share with team members
- **Automation**: Connect to tools like Zapier, Make, or Google Apps Script
- **Cost**: It's free!

## Customization

The code is built to be easily customizable:

- Change colors, text, and branding
- Add or remove features from the flip-card
- Modify form fields
- Add additional analytics or tracking

## Future Plans

I have several ideas for future enhancements:

- More theme options
- Additional form fields
- Analytics dashboard
- Social login options
- Referral tracking

## Contribution

This is an open-source project, and contributions are welcome! Feel free to:

- Submit issues for bugs or feature requests
- Create pull requests to improve the code
- Share your customizations and extensions

## Conclusion

I hope this tool helps fellow developers and indie hackers validate their ideas more quickly. If you find it useful, please consider starring the repository and sharing it with others.

I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions in the comments!
